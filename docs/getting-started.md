## Why makes Nexxus.com so different?

Nexxus.com is developed on a modern technology stack. The main components used are:

* [Netlify](netlify.com) - CI/CD pipeline and CDN hosting
* [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) - Static Site Generator based on the Vue framework
* [Sanity](https://sanity.io/) - Content platform
* [Algolia](https://algolia.com/) - Search as a Service
* Other integrations with the Unilever D2 platform include SignUp, Contact-Us, TheAssetBank (TAB), IRI for StoreLocator, Buy It Now solution, BazaarVoice for Ratings & Reviews.

This document will outline how to manage the content in Sanity.
