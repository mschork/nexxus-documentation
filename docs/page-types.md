The different page types

The Nexxus.com site has 2 key different page types:

* Generic Pages
* Custom Pages

**Custom pages** are based on a specific template, which is designed for a very specific purpose. Within **custom pages** you will find:

* The homepage (Welcome to Nexxus.com)
* FAQ

On the other hand, **Generic Pages** provide you the ability to generate pages for your website, which you have full control of. They are used to create pages like "Our Science" or "Ingredients. These pages are all based on a very flexible template, which you can fill with "Features".
